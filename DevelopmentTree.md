# NextGig App Development Roadmap

## Overview

This document outlines the implementation roadmap for transforming the static Next-Gig-App into a fully functional React Native mobile application with dynamic data using Hasura GraphQL and Apollo Client. The current application consists of static pages and components without real database connectivity or API endpoints.

## Current Architecture

- **Frontend**: Next.js 15, React 19, TypeScript
- **UI**: Tailwind CSS, shadcn/ui components, Radix UI primitives
- **State**: Currently static/mock data

## Target Architecture

- **Frontend**: React Native with TypeScript
- **UI**: React Native components with NativeWind (Tailwind CSS for React Native)
- **API Layer**: Apollo Client for GraphQL operations
- **Backend**: Hasura GraphQL Engine
- **Database**: PostgreSQL (managed by Hasura)
- **Authentication**: JWT-based authentication with refresh tokens
- **Navigation**: React Navigation

- Implement proper keyboard handling
- Consider touch interactions vs mouse interactions
- Plan for offline usage scenarios
- Optimize battery and data usage

### Data Modeling Decisions
- Consider using Postgres JSON fields for flexible schema parts
- Plan for internationalization from the beginning
- Design with scalability in mind (sharding, read replicas)

### Security Considerations
- Implement proper JWT expiration and refresh token flow
- Use secure storage for tokens (Keychain/Keystore)
- Use Hasura's permission system for data access control
- Consider certificate pinning for API requests
- Implement proper error handling that doesn't leak sensitive information

### Performance Considerations
- Use Apollo cache effectively to reduce network requests
- Consider implementing cursor-based pagination for large lists
- Use GraphQL fragments to optimize query composition
- Implement batching for multiple queries
- Optimize React Native rendering with memoization and pure components

### Development Workflow
- Set up a development database with realistic seed data
- Create Hasura migrations for all schema changes
- Use feature branches with isolated preview environments
- Implement end-to-end testing for critical user flows
- Set up device testing strategy (real devices vs emulators)

## Implementation Progress

### Current Status
- Basic React Native project structure set up
- UI components created with NativeWind styling
- Navigation structure implemented with authentication flow
- Hasura backend configured with database schema and permissions
- Apollo Client integration with authentication and offline support
- Job search and filtering implemented with infinite scrolling

### Next Steps
- Implement push notifications for job alerts and application updates
